### Targeted  Sentiment Using Natural Language Inference
The goal of this project is the development of a Deep Learning Model (DLM) to identify sentiment expressed toward a target entity embedded in a piece of text. The backbone of the DLM is a Huggingface Model. 
Inputs the model expects therefore include a piece of text or a tweet, and the target entity. 
Training sets include ACL-14 and SentFin; both of these feature 3-way sentiment polarity (negative, neutral, positive.)
